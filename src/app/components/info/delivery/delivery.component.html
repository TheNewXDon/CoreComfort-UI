  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Delivery Policy</h1>
  <p class="mb-4">
    At ecommerceAcademy, we understand how important it is for you to receive your order in a timely and efficient manner. That's why we have developed a delivery policy to ensure that your items are delivered safely and on time.
  </p>

  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Shipping</h1>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We offer standard and express shipping options to our customers. Standard shipping typically takes 3-5 business days for delivery, while express shipping usually takes 1-2 business days. Shipping costs will be calculated based on the weight and destination of your order at checkout.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We strive to process and ship all orders within 24 hours of receiving them, with the exception of weekends and holidays. Once your order has been shipped, you will receive a tracking number via email so you can track your package's progress.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Please note that we cannot guarantee delivery times due to unforeseen circumstances such as weather, customs delays, or carrier issues. However, we will do everything in our power to ensure that your package arrives as quickly as possible.
  </p>

  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Delivery</h1>
  <p class="mb-4">
    All packages will be delivered to the address provided at checkout. It is your responsibility to ensure that the address is correct and that someone is available to receive the package at the time of delivery. If you need to make any changes to the delivery address, please contact us as soon as possible.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    If no one is available to receive the package at the time of delivery, the carrier will leave a notice with instructions on how to reschedule delivery or pick up your package from a nearby location.
  </p>

  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">International Shipping</h1>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We offer international shipping to select countries. International shipping costs will be calculated based on the weight and destination of your order at checkout. Please note that international orders may be subject to customs fees and import duties, which are the responsibility of the recipient.
  </p>
